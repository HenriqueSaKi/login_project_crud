## Login Project :iphone:
### Introduction
I created this project to improve my skills, specially with Spring Boot, because I am very curious about this framework. <br />
So, the main idea was make a simple user interface app to consume the Spring Boot API.

### Goal :dart:
The app must be capable of make a simple CRUD (create, read, update and delete), through user information registered in a SQL Server database.

### Technologies

| Language | Framework | Layer |
|--|--|--|
| Dart | Flutter | App |
| Java | Spring Boot | Rest Api |
| SQL Server | --- | Database |
