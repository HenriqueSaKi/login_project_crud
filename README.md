## Login Project :iphone:
### Introduction
I created this project to improve my skills, specially with Spring Boot, because I am very curious about this framework.
So, the main idea was make a simple user interface app to consume the Spring Boot API.

### Goal :dart:
The app must be capable of make a simple CRUD (create, read, update and delete), through user information registered in a SQL Server database.

### Functionality :wrench:
:pushpin: Register User 
:pushpin: Sign In 
:pushpin: Update account data
:pushpin: Delete account
